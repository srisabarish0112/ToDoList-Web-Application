# Todo-List App

A Django-based web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. This app features a minimal user interface and the following functionality:

- Create tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Search tasks

Additionally, the app includes user authentication and authorization, ensuring that each user only has access to their own tasks.
