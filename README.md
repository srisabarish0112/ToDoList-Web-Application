## **Procedure**

### 1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Install Python and Django:
     ```bash
     pip install django
     pip install djangorestframework
     ```
   - Create a Django project and a Todo app within the project.
   - Set up the SQLite database by running the migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

### 2. **User Authentication**
   - Implemented login and registration functionality using Django's built-in authentication system.
   - Users can register an account and log in to manage their tasks securely.

### 3. **Task Management**
   - Users can add, edit, and delete tasks. 
   - Each task has a name and description and is stored in the SQLite database.

### 4. **REST API**
   - Created a REST API to interact with tasks.
   - The API allows users to view, create, update, and delete tasks using HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   
### 5. **Frontend Interface**
   - Used HTML/CSS for designing the UI to display login and task management interfaces.
   - JavaScript was used for front-end logic to interact with the backend API.
